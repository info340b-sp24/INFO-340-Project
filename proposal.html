            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <div>
             
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Seattle residents are increasingly concerned about safety due to rising crime rates, visible homelessness, 
                        and ongoing debates about police reform. These issues highlight the need for accessible tools to monitor crime severity 
                        and empower individuals to make informed decisions about personal safety.</p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        One information technology problem related to Seattle crimes is the lack of centralized, easily accessible data on crime 
                        severity and trends across different neighborhoods. While crime statistics may be available through various sources, such 
                        as local law enforcement agencies or government databases, there is often a lack of integration and standardization of this 
                        data. As a result, residents, students, and visitors may struggle to obtain comprehensive and up-to-date information about crime 
                        rates, types of crimes, and areas of concern within the city. This fragmentation of data presents a challenge for individuals seeking 
                        to make informed decisions about their safety and well-being in Seattle.</p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        One existing attempt to address the problem of monitoring crime severity in Seattle is the website <a href="https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/wa/seattle/crime">NeighborhoodScout</a>. However, it has 
                        limitations such as lack of precision in data, communication features, and requiring payment for detailed reports.</p></li>
                </ul>

        <section class="Proposed Application">
            <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
            <div>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><p>The users of the application include residents, students, visitors, and businesses interested in monitoring crime severity in Seattle.
                         While the app can empower minority communities by providing access to safety information, there's a risk of reinforcing biases or stereotypes 
                         if crime data isn't presented accurately or contextually. It's crucial to ensure transparency, accuracy, and inclusivity in the presentation of data to mitigate potential negative impacts on minority groups.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Through this web app, users can communicate the presence of crimes and warns others, and users can upvotes the posts of others to allow top-priority posts to be 
                        visible often; meanwhile, users can also interact with Seattle map to see visualized crimes of various levels and details in different areas; furthermore, users can store posts from other users and
                        map informaton as cards in separate page for future review.</p></li>
                    <li><p>The information users can view is the <a href="https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5/about_data">"SPD Crime Data: 2008-Present,"</a> which is from City of Seattle open database.</p></li>
                    <li><p>This app offers a comprehensive solution to the challenge of monitoring crime severity in Seattle. By providing cumulative data collection insights into crime rates and patterns, it enables users to make informed 
                        safety decisions. Furthermore, it fosters community collaboration, empowering residents, including minority groups, to actively participate in crime prevention efforts and contribute to creating a safer environment for 
                        everyone in the city.</p></li>
