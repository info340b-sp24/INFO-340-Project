            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <p>
                Seattle, known for its vibrant food scene, offers an overwhelming number of dining options which can be daunting for residents and tourists alike. While various platforms provide restaurant listings and reviews, they often lack personalized sorting and organization features that cater to individual dietary needs and preferences.
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary challenge this application aims to address is the difficulty in efficiently exploring and organizing restaurant options in the Seattle area. The current solutions do not offer sufficient tools for users to filter and sort eateries based on comprehensive criteria such as dietary restrictions, ambiance preferences, or specific service options.
            </p>
            <p>
                An example of an existing platform is Yelp, but it often requires navigating through numerous reviews to find relevant information, which can be time-consuming and not user-specific.

            <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
            <p>
                The "Seattle Dine Explorer" app will leverage data from the Seattle Area Restaurants dataset collected from Yelp.com to allow users to find restaurants based on highly specific criteria. This includes dietary restrictions, price range, user ratings, and services offered, enhancing the dining out experience in Seattle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Features of the app will include:
                <ul>
                    <li>A sophisticated filtering system to sort restaurants by dietary needs (e.g., vegan, gluten-free), price, ratings, and services (e.g., outdoor seating, delivery options).</li>
                    <li>Interactive maps showing restaurants in different neighborhoods, allowing users to plan dining out based on location.</li>
                    <li>Personalized lists where users can save their favorite restaurants or create wish lists for future dining plans.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                This app will not only make it easier for users to navigate the diverse culinary landscape of Seattle but also help them to discover new dining experiences tailored to their preferences.
