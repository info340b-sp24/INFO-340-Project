            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <p>
                Understanding the nutritional content of food is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
                With rising concerns about obesity, heart disease, and other health issues related to diet, many people are increasingly interested in tracking their food intake.
                They want to understand the fat, protein, vitamin, and calorie content of their meals to make healthier choices. However, current information technology tools often lack comprehensive nutrient databases or
                don't offer personalized features, leaving users with incomplete insights into their diet's impact on their health.
            </p>
            <p>
                An identified problem in this domain is the absence of a user-friendly web application that provides detailed nutritional information
                and allows users to build their daily diet plan based on a comprehensive food database. This app should enable users to add food items to
                their daily diet, track their caloric intake, and see detailed nutrient breakdowns. Additionally, it should offer interactive quizzes to help
                users expand their knowledge of vitamins and other essential nutrients.
            </p>
            <p>
                Several existing web apps focus on calorie counting or general nutrition tracking, but they often lack the depth to address a broader range of nutrients.
                Apps like MyFitnessPal and Cronometer, for example, primarily focus on calorie counting and macronutrients but don't provide in-depth information on vitamins
                and other micronutrients. A new web app could bridge this gap by offering a more comprehensive analysis of food nutrients, providing users with a better understanding
                of their diet's health impact. This app could also promote better dietary habits through educational features, helping users make informed decisions and ultimately leading to healthier lifestyles.

            <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
            <p>
                The proposed web app is designed to help users understand the nutritional content of their food,
                track their dietary intake, and make healthier choices. The primary users of the app are individuals interested
                in improving their diet, such as health-conscious people, dieters, athletes, and those managing chronic health conditions
                through nutrition. Given the focus on health and well-being, this app can positively impact minority groups and other vulnerable
                populations by providing an accessible resource for understanding and managing their diet. The dataset has over 8000 food types with data from Kaggle,
                and further there will be sub-dataset and customized dataset(for quiz) for better user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Features of the app will include:
                <ul>
                    <li>First, it provides a searchable database of foods with detailed nutritional information, including fat, protein, vitamins, minerals, and caloric content.
                        Users can search for food items to learn about their nutritional composition or scan barcodes to quickly add them to a list.</li>

                    <li>The second key feature allows users to build a personalized daily diet plan by selecting foods from the database and seeing their total caloric intake and
                        nutrient breakdown. This feature helps users visualize their diet's impact on their health and identify areas for improvement.</li>

                    <li>The third major feature is an interactive quiz that tests users' knowledge of vitamins and other essential nutrients. The quiz includes questions on food sources,
                        daily recommended values, and the health benefits of various vitamins and minerals. This feature serves as an educational tool, helping users deepen their understanding of nutrition.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                This app will not only make it easier for users to navigate the diverse nutrition information of common food but also help them to learn about why and how nutrition are important to their daily lives.
